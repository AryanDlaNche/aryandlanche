			<h1> WHAT IS THE ANTI-TERROR LAW?</h1>
			<p id='anti'> The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, officially designated as Republic Act No. 11479, 
							is a Philippine law whose intent is to prevent, prohibit, and penalize terrorism in 
							the Philippines. The law was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 3, 2020 and 
							effectively replaced the Human Security Act of 2007 on July 18, 2020. The government has 
							come out with the implementing rules and regulations of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). Among 
							other things, the IRR empowers the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) to release to the public a list 
							of individuals and groups it “designates” as terrorists before giving them the chance to clear 
							their names. The caveat that protests and criticisms will be deemed terrorist acts if they are 
							seen as intended to cause harm and endanger public safety remains unchanged. (officialgazette.gov.ph) </p>
